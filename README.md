# CodeClassifier
A machine learning classifier that will tell you what programming language a string is in.

## Project Proposal
For our project, we want to make a program that uses machine learning to tell you the programming language that a given string is in. For example, the user might give our program the string `public static void main(String[] args) {` and our program would output `Java`.
