# CodeClassifier
A machine learning classifier that will tell you what programming language a string is in.

## Project Proposal
For our project, we want to make a program that uses machine learning to tell you the programming language that a given string is in. For example, the user might give our program the string `public static void main(String[] args)` and our program would output `Java`. For our final project, we envision a simple web interface that would allow the user to input their string and would display the result of our classification algorithm. We are a little unsure about what machine learning algorithm to use for this project. We initially thought that K-means clustering would work, but are now unsure since we don't know how we would update the centroids. We then considered supervised algorithms. We understand the k-neighbors concept, and that seems like something we could hard code without using any libraries, but we also started reading about other ways to go about this and came across the Naive Bayes method (although we are unsure exactly how this works). Do you have any advice or suggestions, specifically on how we should go about our ML? Our first goal is to complete the classifier algorithm. After that is complete, we will start working on the web interface, and finally if we have extra time we will work to make the app look pretty.
